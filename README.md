# Employment-Project

Three .java files is what I use to do first-step data cleaning and extraction
The Analytics.scala file is what I use to do linear regression
The Extraction+Brief Insight. txt file is what I use do a shallow insight.

All files should be run on an HPC terminal.

Thanks to the help of Professor Malavet(NYU).
